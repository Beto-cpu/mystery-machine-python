# intro
This code along with a physical prototype was used as a final project for a a assignment called "ALGORITHMS DESIGN". It uses image recognition and potential fields algorithms to decide the actions of a robot which have to find the shortest rote from its position to a goal, all this while it avoid obstacles and make real-time corrections.

# How to use
The program must be connected to a mobil robot via Bluetooth. The robot have to interpret '0' as stop, '1' as go forward, '2' as turn left and '3' as turn right. Besides, the velocity should be set to give enough time to corrections.
